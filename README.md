# Jump, Tobi! Jump!

*Jump, Tobi! Jump!* is a Jump'n'Run Android 2.1 game (or rather demo) I
programmed in 2013. I made horrible design decisions (especially concerning the
main loop) and the OpenGL stuff is crap (there're so many avoidable drawcalls),
it's a miracle the game runs on my 2009 phone.

But of all games I programmed I learned the most from this little Jump'n'Run.
